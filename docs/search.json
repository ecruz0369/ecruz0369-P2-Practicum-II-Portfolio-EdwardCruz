Given the importance of bee colonies in agriculture, it was logical to source data from the following two authoritative websites: 1. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2. Bee Informed Partnership: This site offers detailed insights and research on bee colony management and health, contributing valuable information on the status and trends of bee populations.

We then filtered out other observations that did not directly deal with the data we are exploring. We are looking for cause of death to bee colonies and how they are affected by mites and climate change so we wanted to single out data that represented the losses so we can explore the different states by year and determine how the colonies were affected.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\nlibrary(here)\n\n\n# Install and load the here package\n#install.packages(\"here\")\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere()\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\"\n\n# Create a 'data' directory within the project\ndir.create(here(\"data\"))\n\nWarning in dir.create(here(\"data\")): 'C:\\Users\\ecruz\\OneDrive\\Documents\\UTSA -\nData Science Program\\Semester Classes\\Practicum II\nRepository\\P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\\data' already exists\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndata &lt;- read.csv(here(\"Databystate.csv\"))\n\n\n#data &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/DatabyState.csv\")\n\n\n# Select all columns except 3, 6, and 9\nData_Clean &lt;- dplyr::select(data, -c(3, 6, 9))\n\n\n# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.\n\nwrite.csv(Data_Clean, \"Data_Clean.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n#write.csv(Data_Clean, \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/docs/Databystate_Clean.csv\")\n\n\n# Assuming your data frame is named \"data\"\n\n# Filter for rows where \"Loss\" or \"Deadout\" is present in any column (case-insensitive)\n\nlibrary(stringr)  # Load stringr package for regular expressions\ndata_filtered &lt;- Data_Clean[rowSums(sapply(data, grepl, pattern = c(\"Loss\"), ignore.case = TRUE)) &gt; 0, ]\n\n\n# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.\n\nwrite.csv(data_filtered, \"Data_Filtered.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n#write.csv(Data_Clean, \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/docs/Databystate_Filtered.csv\")\n\n\n# View data str to see what class they are.\n\nstr(data_filtered)\n\n'data.frame':   718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ Year      : int  2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 ...\n $ Period    : chr  \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" ...\n $ State     : chr  \"ALABAMA\" \"ARIZONA\" \"ARKANSAS\" \"CALIFORNIA\" ...\n $ State.ANSI: int  1 4 5 6 8 9 12 13 15 16 ...\n $ Data.Item : chr  \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" ...\n $ Value     : chr  \"250\" \"2,600\" \"180\" \"19,000\" ...\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Boxplot of Value by Year and Data Item\nThe third image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” from 2015 to 2017. The boxplot provides insights into: - The central tendency and spread of losses due to both disorders. - Presence of outliers indicates that there are occasional, significantly higher losses. - Comparative analysis shows that both types of losses have varying distributions each year.\nThis indicates that while both types of losses are present each year, the magnitude and frequency of extreme loss events can differ, suggesting variability in the factors contributing to colony losses.\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(here)\n\nstr(data_filtered)\n\n'data.frame':   718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ Year      : int  2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 ...\n $ Period    : chr  \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" ...\n $ State     : chr  \"ALABAMA\" \"ARIZONA\" \"ARKANSAS\" \"CALIFORNIA\" ...\n $ State.ANSI: int  1 4 5 6 8 9 12 13 15 16 ...\n $ Data.Item : chr  \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" ...\n $ Value     : chr  \"250\" \"2,600\" \"180\" \"19,000\" ...\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata_filtered &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"Data_Filtered.csv\"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n# Convert 'Value' to numeric\ndata_filtered$Value &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", data_filtered$Value))\n\n# Handle missing values by replacing NAs with the median value\ndata_filtered$Value[is.na(data_filtered$Value)] &lt;- median(data_filtered$Value, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Boxplot of Value by Year and Data.Item\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Value, fill = Data.Item)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Value by Year and Data.Item\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Scatterplot of Value by State ANSI\nThe fourth image is a scatterplot showing values for different states (ANSI coded) across the years 2015 to 2017. Key points include: - Each color represents a different year (2015: Red, 2016: Green, 2017: Blue). - The scatterplot reveals the distribution of values across states and highlights any trends or patterns over the three years.\nThis scatterplot indicates that while some states experience consistently high or low values, others show significant variability year over year. This could suggest regional differences in factors affecting bee colony health.\n\n# Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = State.ANSI, y = Value, color = factor(Year))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\", x = \"State.ANSI\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Boxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n# Assuming data_filtered is already loaded and has the required columns\n\n# Create the plot\np &lt;- ggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = Period, y = Value, fill = Data.Item)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Value by Period and Data.Item\", x = \"Period\", y = \"Value\")\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Boxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n\n3.3.5 Overall Analysis\n\nThe composition of honey indicates its high sugar content, essential for energy but also highlighting the presence of beneficial components like enzymes and vitamins.\nThe spread of Varroa mites map highlights the widespread and growing impact of these pests over time, emphasizing the need for ongoing management and control efforts.\nThe boxplots and scatterplots provide a detailed view of the variability and trends in colony losses due to different factors, both over time and across different regions. These plots suggest that while losses are a consistent issue, their magnitude and causes can vary widely, pointing to the need for tailored strategies to address colony health.\n\nThese visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by bee colonies, from composition and health to external threats like Varroa mites and seasonal variations in losses.\n\n\n3.3.6 VARROA MITE EXPOSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.7 VARROA MITE\n\n\n\n\n\n************** Leo provided additional code below and works perfectly********************\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nWarning: package 'reshape2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\nlibrary(cluster)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cluster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:maps':\n\n    votes.repub\n\nlibrary(car)\n\nLoading required package: carData\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    some\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n\nlibrary(factoextra)\n\nWarning: package 'factoextra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWelcome!

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

    "text": "Hello fellow students,\nMy name is Edward Cruz, Jr., and I’m excited to share a bit about myself with you. I am proud to be Native American and hold a BBA in Accounting from Incarnate Word College ‘88’, now known as the University of the Incarnate Word. Additionally, I have earned two master’s degrees: an MBA from Texas A&M University-San Antonio ‘21’ and an MSBA from Texas A&M University-Commerce ‘22’.\nMy journey in life has been enriched by my 24 years of service in the United States Marine Corps, where I retired with the rank of Master Sergeant (MSgt) and an Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) veteran. After my military career, I transitioned into the supplier diversity market, where I have over seventeen years of experience. During this time, I found great satisfaction in assisting small and diverse businesses in securing contracting opportunities. It was in this role that I discovered my passion for data analysis, as I frequently presented visual outcomes to public board members and stakeholders. This newfound interest has led me here, where I am eager to further enhance my data analysis skills.\n“Pics From Back in the Day- Good Times”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a personal note, I have been blessed with a supportive and patient wife, and we have been happily married for over 30 years. We have two wonderful daughters: our eldest recently graduated from Texas A&M University-San Antonio, and our youngest is a second-year student at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\nIn my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. I am passionate about cooking, farming, and beekeeping—raising and recovering bees and simply watching their lively activities at my hives brings me immense joy. I also love being outdoors, fly fishing, and staying active as a dedicated gym enthusiast.\n\n\n\nUncapped Honey from My Hives\n\n\nI look forward to getting to know all of you and learning together on this exciting journey. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy coding background has only been via instructional environments with exposure to SQL, R, and Python. https://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html#Scatterplot"

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

The very low R-squared value indicates that population size explains only a tiny fraction of the variation in life expectancy. This suggests that other factors, such as healthcare access, economic conditions, education, and other social determinants, are likely much more important in explaining differences in life expectancy across African countries. TO reiterate, there is tremendous suffering and mortality with the children of the populations however the resiliency of this country has been successfully documented indicating the economics, education and healthcare is improving to continue allowing the population with access to these areas to successfully prosper and survive.\n*** This part contributed by Leonel Salazar, IGE436 ***"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

The very low R-squared value indicates that population size explains only a tiny fraction of the variation in life expectancy. This suggests that other factors, such as healthcare access, economic conditions, education, and other social determinants, are likely much more important in explaining differences in life expectancy across African countries. TO reiterate, there is tremendous suffering and mortality with the children of the populations however the resiliency of this country has been successfully documented indicating the economics, education and healthcare is improving to continue allowing the population with access to these areas to successfully prosper and survive.\n*** This part contributed by Leonel Salazar, IGE436 ***"

VALUE IS COUNT.\nThe above data set is organized by year, state, period of the year, type of loss, and count. There are only three observed years, with observations from 2015 to 2017. Loss by collapse disorder describes a colony that losses a majority of its worker bees. Loss by deadout describes a loss of the entire colony: workers, drones, larvae, pupa, and queen. The bar chart shown below depicts loss count by type and period. The periods roughly follow North American seasons; April through June is spring, January through March is winter, July through September is summer, and October through December is fall.

We are looking for cause of death to bee colonies and how they are affected by mites and climate change so we wanted to single out data that represented the losses so we can explore the different states by year and determine how the colonies were affected.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\nlibrary(here)\n\n\n# Install and load the here package\n#install.packages(\"here\")\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere()\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\"\n\n# Create a 'data' directory within the project\ndir.create(here(\"data\"))\n\nWarning in dir.create(here(\"data\")): 'C:\\Users\\ecruz\\OneDrive\\Documents\\UTSA -\nData Science Program\\Semester Classes\\Practicum II\nRepository\\P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\\data' already exists\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndata &lt;- read.csv(here(\"Databystate.csv\"))\n\n\n#data &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/DatabyState.csv\")\n\n\n# Select all columns except 3, 6, and 9\nData_Clean &lt;- dplyr::select(data, -c(3, 6, 9))\n\n\n# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.\n\nwrite.csv(Data_Clean, \"Data_Clean.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n#write.csv(Data_Clean, \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/docs/Databystate_Clean.csv\")\n\n\n# Assuming your data frame is named \"data\"\n\n# Filter for rows where \"Loss\" or \"Deadout\" is present in any column (case-insensitive)\n\nlibrary(stringr)  # Load stringr package for regular expressions\ndata_filtered &lt;- Data_Clean[rowSums(sapply(data, grepl, pattern = c(\"Loss\"), ignore.case = TRUE)) &gt; 0, ]\n\n\n# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.\n\nwrite.csv(data_filtered, \"Data_Filtered.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n#write.csv(Data_Clean, \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/docs/Databystate_Filtered.csv\")\n\n\n# View data str to see what class they are.\n\nstr(data_filtered)\n\n'data.frame':   718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ Year      : int  2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 ...\n $ Period    : chr  \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" ...\n $ State     : chr  \"ALABAMA\" \"ARIZONA\" \"ARKANSAS\" \"CALIFORNIA\" ...\n $ State.ANSI: int  1 4 5 6 8 9 12 13 15 16 ...\n $ Data.Item : chr  \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" ...\n $ Value     : chr  \"250\" \"2,600\" \"180\" \"19,000\" ...\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Value by Year and Data Item\nThe third image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” from 2015 to 2017.

Key points include: - Each color represents a different year (2015: Red, 2016: Green, 2017: Blue). - The scatterplot reveals the distribution of values across states and highlights any trends or patterns over the three years.\nThis scatterplot indicates that while some states experience consistently high or low values, others show significant variability year over year. This could suggest regional differences in factors affecting bee colony health.\n\n# Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = State.ANSI, y = Value, color = factor(Year))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\", x = \"State.ANSI\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n# Assuming data_filtered is already loaded and has the required columns\n\n# Create the plot\np &lt;- ggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = Period, y = Value, fill = Data.Item)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Value by Period and Data.Item\", x = \"Period\", y = \"Value\")\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n\nOverall Analysis\n\nThe composition of honey indicates its high sugar content, essential for energy but also highlighting the presence of beneficial components like enzymes and vitamins.\nThe spread of Varroa mites map highlights the widespread and growing impact of these pests over time, emphasizing the need for ongoing management and control efforts.\nThe boxplots and scatterplots provide a detailed view of the variability and trends in colony losses due to different factors, both over time and across different regions. These plots suggest that while losses are a consistent issue, their magnitude and causes can vary widely, pointing to the need for tailored strategies to address colony health.\n\nThese visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by bee colonies, from composition and health to external threats like Varroa mites and seasonal variations in losses.\n\n\nVARROA MITE EXPOSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARROA MITE\n\n\n\n\n\n************** Leo provided additional code below and works perfectly********************\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nWarning: package 'reshape2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\nlibrary(cluster)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cluster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:maps':\n\n    votes.repub\n\nlibrary(car)\n\nLoading required package: carData\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    some\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n\nlibrary(factoextra)\n\nWarning: package 'factoextra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWelcome!

Given the importance of bee colonies in agriculture, it was logical to source data from the following two authoritative websites: 1. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2. Bee Informed Partnership: This site offers detailed insights and research on bee colony management and health, contributing valuable information on the status and trends of bee populations.

We are looking for cause of death to bee colonies and how they are affected by mites and climate change so we wanted to single out data that represented the losses so we can explore the different states by year and determine how the colonies were affected.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\nlibrary(here)\n\n\n# Install and load the here package\n#install.packages(\"here\")\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere()\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\"\n\n# Create a 'data' directory within the project\ndir.create(here(\"data\"))\n\nWarning in dir.create(here(\"data\")): 'C:\\Users\\ecruz\\OneDrive\\Documents\\UTSA -\nData Science Program\\Semester Classes\\Practicum II\nRepository\\P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz\\data' already exists\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndata &lt;- read.csv(here(\"Databystate.csv\"))\n\n\n#data &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/DatabyState.csv\")\n\n\n# Select all columns except 3, 6, and 9\nData_Clean &lt;- dplyr::select(data, -c(3, 6, 9))\n\n\n# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.\n\nwrite.csv(Data_Clean, \"Data_Clean.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n#write.csv(Data_Clean, \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/docs/Databystate_Clean.csv\")\n\n\n# Assuming your data frame is named \"data\"\n\n# Filter for rows where \"Loss\" or \"Deadout\" is present in any column (case-insensitive)\n\nlibrary(stringr)  # Load stringr package for regular expressions\ndata_filtered &lt;- Data_Clean[rowSums(sapply(data, grepl, pattern = c(\"Loss\"), ignore.case = TRUE)) &gt; 0, ]\n\n\n# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.\n\nwrite.csv(data_filtered, \"Data_Filtered.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n#write.csv(Data_Clean, \"C:/Users/ecruz/OneDrive/Documents/UTSA - Data Science Program/Semester Classes/Practicum II #Repository/P2-Practicum-II-Portfolio-EdwardCruz/docs/Databystate_Filtered.csv\")\n\n\n# View data str to see what class they are.\n\nstr(data_filtered)\n\n'data.frame':   718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ Year      : int  2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 ...\n $ Period    : chr  \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" ...\n $ State     : chr  \"ALABAMA\" \"ARIZONA\" \"ARKANSAS\" \"CALIFORNIA\" ...\n $ State.ANSI: int  1 4 5 6 8 9 12 13 15 16 ...\n $ Data.Item : chr  \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" ...\n $ Value     : chr  \"250\" \"2,600\" \"180\" \"19,000\" ...\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Value by Year and Data Item\nThe third image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” from 2015 to 2017.

Key points include: - Each color represents a different year (2015: Red, 2016: Green, 2017: Blue). - The scatterplot reveals the distribution of values across states and highlights any trends or patterns over the three years.\nThis scatterplot indicates that while some states experience consistently high or low values, others show significant variability year over year. This could suggest regional differences in factors affecting bee colony health.\n\n# Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = State.ANSI, y = Value, color = factor(Year))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\", x = \"State.ANSI\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n# Assuming data_filtered is already loaded and has the required columns\n\n# Create the plot\np &lt;- ggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = Period, y = Value, fill = Data.Item)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Value by Period and Data.Item\", x = \"Period\", y = \"Value\")\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n\nOverall Analysis\n\nThe composition of honey indicates its high sugar content, essential for energy but also highlighting the presence of beneficial components like enzymes and vitamins.\nThe spread of Varroa mites map highlights the widespread and growing impact of these pests over time, emphasizing the need for ongoing management and control efforts.\nThe boxplots and scatterplots provide a detailed view of the variability and trends in colony losses due to different factors, both over time and across different regions. These plots suggest that while losses are a consistent issue, their magnitude and causes can vary widely, pointing to the need for tailored strategies to address colony health.\n\nThese visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by bee colonies, from composition and health to external threats like Varroa mites and seasonal variations in losses.\n\n\nVARROA MITE EXPOSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARROA MITE\n\n\n\n\n\n************** Leo provided additional code below and works perfectly********************\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nWarning: package 'reshape2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\nlibrary(cluster)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cluster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:maps':\n\n    votes.repub\n\nlibrary(car)\n\nLoading required package: carData\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    some\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n\nlibrary(factoextra)\n\nWarning: package 'factoextra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWelcome!

Given the importance of bee colonies in agriculture, it was logical to source data from the following two authoritative websites: 1. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2. Bee Informed Partnership: This site offers detailed insights and research on bee colony management and health, contributing valuable information on the status and trends of bee populations.

These plots suggest that while losses are a consistent issue, their magnitude and causes can vary widely, pointing to the need for tailored strategies to address colony health.\n\nThese visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by bee colonies, from composition and health to external threats like Varroa mites and seasonal variations in losses.\n\n\nVARROA MITE EXPOSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARROA MITE\n\n\n\n\n\n************** Leo provided additional code below and works perfectly********************\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nWarning: package 'reshape2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\nlibrary(cluster)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cluster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:maps':\n\n    votes.repub\n\nlibrary(car)\n\nLoading required package: carData\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    some\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n\nlibrary(factoextra)\n\nWarning: package 'factoextra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWelcome!

The data highlights the topic on hive losses attributed to mites, bacterial infections, and environmental factors related to global warming. Through advanced data visualization techniques in R, we aim to demonstrate and validate the detrimental effects of these factors on honeybee colonies, highlighting the consequent implications for honey production and broader food security. Dennis and Kemp’s study on honey bee hive collapse (Dennis & Kemp, 2016) provides important insights into Allee effects and ecological resilience. Warmer climate may impact bees(Rajagopalan, DeGrandi-Hoffman, Pruett, et al., 2024)"

USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2.

The boxplot provides insights into: - The central tendency and spread of losses due to both disorders. - Presence of outliers indicates that there are occasional, significantly higher losses. - Comparative analysis shows that both types of losses have varying distributions each year.\nThis indicates that while both types of losses are present each year, the magnitude and frequency of extreme loss events can differ, suggesting variability in the factors contributing to colony losses.\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(here)\n\nstr(data_filtered)\n\n'data.frame':   718 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ Year      : int  2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 2017 ...\n $ Period    : chr  \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" \"JAN THRU MAR\" ...\n $ State     : chr  \"ALABAMA\" \"ARIZONA\" \"ARKANSAS\" \"CALIFORNIA\" ...\n $ State.ANSI: int  1 4 5 6 8 9 12 13 15 16 ...\n $ Data.Item : chr  \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" \"LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER\" ...\n $ Value     : chr  \"250\" \"2,600\" \"180\" \"19,000\" ...\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata_filtered &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"Data_Filtered.csv\"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n# Convert 'Value' to numeric\ndata_filtered$Value &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", data_filtered$Value))\n\n# Handle missing values by replacing NAs with the median value\ndata_filtered$Value[is.na(data_filtered$Value)] &lt;- median(data_filtered$Value, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Boxplot of Value by Year and Data.Item\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Value, fill = Data.Item)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Value by Year and Data.Item\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Scatterplot of Value by State ANSI\nThe fourth image is a scatterplot showing values for different states (ANSI coded) across the years 2015 to 2017. Key points include: - Each color represents a different year (2015: Red, 2016: Green, 2017: Blue). - The scatterplot reveals the distribution of values across states and highlights any trends or patterns over the three years.\nThis scatterplot indicates that while some states experience consistently high or low values, others show significant variability year over year. This could suggest regional differences in factors affecting bee colony health.\n\n# Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = State.ANSI, y = Value, color = factor(Year))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Value by State.ANSI\", x = \"State.ANSI\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Boxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n# Assuming data_filtered is already loaded and has the required columns\n\n# Create the plot\np &lt;- ggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = Period, y = Value, fill = Data.Item)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Value by Period and Data.Item\", x = \"Period\", y = \"Value\")\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Boxplot of Value by Period and Data Item\nThe fifth image is a boxplot comparing the values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year: - APR THRU JUN - JAN THRU MAR - JUL THRU SEP - OCT THRU DEC\nKey insights include: - Seasonal trends in colony losses, with some periods showing higher median losses or more variability. - Outliers indicate extreme loss events occurring in specific periods.\nThis seasonal analysis suggests that certain times of the year are more prone to higher losses, potentially due to environmental factors, resource availability, or management practices.\n\n\n3.3.5 Overall Analysis\n\nThe composition of honey indicates its high sugar content, essential for energy but also highlighting the presence of beneficial components like enzymes and vitamins.\nThe spread of Varroa mites map highlights the widespread and growing impact of these pests over time, emphasizing the need for ongoing management and control efforts.\nThe boxplots and scatterplots provide a detailed view of the variability and trends in colony losses due to different factors, both over time and across different regions. These plots suggest that while losses are a consistent issue, their magnitude and causes can vary widely, pointing to the need for tailored strategies to address colony health.\n\nThese visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by bee colonies, from composition and health to external threats like Varroa mites and seasonal variations in losses.\n\n\n3.3.6 VARROA MITE EXPOSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.7 VARROA MITE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nWarning: package 'reshape2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\nlibrary(cluster)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cluster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:maps':\n\n    votes.repub\n\nlibrary(car)\n\nLoading required package: carData\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    some\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n\nlibrary(factoextra)\n\nWarning: package 'factoextra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWelcome!
